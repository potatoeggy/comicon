"""
Tools for working with the Comicon Intermediate Representation (CIR).

The CIR is a folder that must contain the following:

- `comicon.json`: a JSON file containing the metadata for the comic (see `base.py`)
- `{chapter-slug}/`: folders where `chapter-slug` is the slugified chapter name as
defined in `comicon.json`
    - `{number}.{ext}`: ordered image files representing one comic page (min. 1)
- `cover.{ext}`: a file containing the cover of the comic. Extensions allowed include
jpg, jpeg, js2, png, gif, and webp.

All folders as well as the cover image must be declared in `comicon.json`. Only image
files are allowed in the chapter folders, but any file is allowed in the root of
the CIR folder.

Extra files or folders in the CIR root will be ignored.
